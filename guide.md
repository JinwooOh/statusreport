# Status Report Demo

## Overview

3.  Type your name on the input box. Your name should be showed up automatically
4.  If everything looks good, click the "SUBMIT" button.

#### Searching

1. Two searching options are provided: search by user and search by course. Choose one of the options to search.

    1.  Type valid start date and end date. The dates are based on task completion dates not reporting dates.
    2.  Type username. The username should show up automatically.
    3.  Course task will show up in "Course task" table, and admin task will show up in "Admin task" table.
